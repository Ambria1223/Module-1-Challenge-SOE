# Module-1-Challenge-SOE

## Description

Horiseon is a social solution service that provides businesses with insight on optimizing their visibility on search engines. Horiseon also describes how social media marketing and online reputation management services go hand in hand when it comes to search engine optimization.

The motivation behind this project was to optimize the search for this website by making the images accessible for users who are visually impaired. I was able to use the alt tab in HTML in order to add concise yet descriptive words to the picture within the website.
